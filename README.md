# Encryption Demo

A short demonstration of encryption of various methods, encluding Diffie-Hellman and RSA. Perhaps some others will be added too. 

This is not performant code. It is meant simply to be a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of encryption.

You should use this with a vitual environment. To do so, navigate to your directory and create a cirtual environment by typing `python3 -m venv venv`. Then activate the virtual environment by typing `source venv/bin/activate`. There will be an indication that the virtual environment is working. After this, install the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. After the requirements are installed run `jupyter notebook` and everything should spin up in the browser. The requirements only need to be installed the first time.

From the top you can `run` a cell by selecting the cell and clicking `run`, or going to `menu` `&rarr;` `cell` `&rarr;` `run all cells`.
