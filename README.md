# encryption-demo

A short demonstration of encryption of various methods, encluding Diffie-Hellman and RSA. Perhaps some others will be added too. 

This is not performant code. It is meant simply to be a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of encryption.

To get started, make sure you have the latest version of Python installed. `cd` into the project directory then run `jupyter notebook`. The code will open in a browser. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed you can install it with the command `pip install jupyer`. Then a browswer window will open where you'll see the demos. Click on the one you're interested in learning about.

From the top you can `run` a cell by selecting the cell and clicking `run`, or going to `menu` `&rarr;` `cell` `&rarr;` `run all cells`.
