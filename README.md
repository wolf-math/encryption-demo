# Encryption Demo

A short demonstration of encryption of various methods, encluding Diffie-Hellman and RSA. Perhaps some others will be added too. 

This is not performant code. It is meant simply to be a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of encryption.

## Getting Started
You should use this with a vitual environment. In your terminal, navigate to the cloned project then follow the steps below. 
1. Type `python3 -m venv venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`. There will be an indication in your terminal that the virtual environment is working.
3. Install the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `jupyter notebook` and everything should spin up in the browser. The requirements only need to be installed the first time.
5. Double-click the file you want to demo.
6. When the Jupyter Notebook is open, you can `run` a cell by selecting the cell and clicking `run`, or going to `menu` ==> `cell` ==> `run all cells`.
7. Some of the cells will prompt you for input.
