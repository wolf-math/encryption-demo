# encryption-demo

A short demonstration of encryption of various methods, encluding Diffie-Hellman and RSA. Perhaps some others will be added too. 

This is not performant code. It is meant simply to be a learning tool to demonstrate the concepts of encryption.

To get started `cd` into the project directory then run `jupyter notebook`. The code will open in a browser. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed you can install it with the command `pip install jupyer`.
